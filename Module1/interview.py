Key Differences:

Python vs. Java – Python has a simpler syntax, whereas Java requires more boilerplate code.

Python vs. C++ – Python is dynamically typed and easier to use, while C++ is faster but more complex.

Python vs. JavaScript – Python is mainly for backend applications, whereas JavaScript is primarily for frontend.
